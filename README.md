# Face-Mask-Detection-using-AI
In the new world of corona virus, multidisciplinary efforts have been organized to slow the spread of the pandemic. The AI community has also been a part of these endeavors. In particular, developments for monitoring social distancing or identifying face masks have made-the-headlines. But all this hype and anxiety to show off results as fast as possible, added up to the usual AI overpromising factor , may be signaling the wrong idea that solving some of these use cases is almost trivial due to the mighty powers of AI. In an effort to paint a more complete picture, we decided to show the creative process behind a solution for a seemingly simple use case in computer vision: Detect people that pass through a security-like camera. Identify face mask usage. Collect reliable statistics (% people wearing masks).
